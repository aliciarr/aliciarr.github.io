{"name":"Aliciarr.GitHub.io","tagline":"Alicia R Riley","body":"### About Me.\r\nI'm a doctoral student in [Sociology at the University of Chicago](http://sociology.uchicago.edu/people/grad_students/AliciaRiley.shtml). I specialize in social demography and social epidemiology. I study how differences in residential environments can contribute to disparities in health and wellbeing. I am currently focused on better understanding the effects of living in an environment of concentrated disadvantage. \r\n\r\n### Current Projects.\r\nAs a Predoctoral Trainee at the [Center on Demography and Economics of Aging](http://coa.norc.org//#People/Training/PredocTrainees), and in collaboration with Louise Hawkley and Kathleen Cagney, I am using data from the [National Social Life Health and Aging Project](http://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-project.aspx) to see if living in a disadvantaged neighborhood impacts residential relocation decisions in later life and how this may vary by race. \r\n\r\nIn collaboration with Forrest Stuart, Grant Buhr and partners at the YMCA [Youth Safety and Violence Prevention Program](http://www.ymcachicago.org/programs/youth-safety-and-violence-prevention), I am studying how adolescents navigate neighborhood violence in the digital age. This project is made possible through funding from the University of Chicago [Urban Health Initiative](http://uhi.uchospitals.edu/).\r\n\r\n### Broader Interests.\r\nI have a background in social epidemiology and community health, and much of my past work focused on health issues facing Latino communities in the U.S. and Mexico.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in computational methods for analysis of new data sources. For example, I admire the work done by the [Data Science for Social Good](http://dssg.io) team at University of Chicago.\r\n \r\n###Learn more. \r\n[Here](http://www.arriley.com/arriley/work.html) are some examples of my past work.\r\n\r\nAnd [my CV](http://www.arriley.com/arriley/cv_files/RileyAlicia_CV_public%20version%20April%202014.pdf).\r\n\r\n###Connect with me!\r\n[arriley[at]uchicago[dot]edu](arriley@uchicago.edu)      \r\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/aliciacita)      \r\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/alicia-riley/20/728/681)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
