<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/alicia.riley">Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco</a>. I specialize in the sociology of health inequalities, social demography, and Critical Race Theory. I study the fundamental causes of health inequality as "systems of exposure" that vary across local contexts in how they shape population distributions of health and mortality. I am especially interested in the ways that the health effects of structural racism and socioeconomic inequality can be exacerbated or disrupted through policy.  </p>
<p>I completed my PhD and MA in Sociology at University of Chicago, my MPH in Epidemiology/Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and my MA in Latin American Studies at Stanford University.</p>

<p>
My dissertation tested the potential for specific state policies to moderate the educational gradient in mortality. I drew on nationally representative data from two longitudinal surveys (PSID and NSHAP) and combined it with data on state and local policy environments to answer questions about the modifiability of social gradients in health. In my research, I consider the specific cases of state cigarette taxes and state unemployment insurance, as well as a more holistic state policy index. I use these empirical cases to propose a system of typologies for understanding how and why different state policies moderate the SES gradient in mortality.</p>

<p>Check out my latest article: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100555">Advancing the study of health inequality: Fundamental causes as systems of exposure</a> </p>
<p>Check out my work on how to better study structural racism and health: <a href="http://rdcu.be/tbxk">Neighborhood Disadvantage, Residential Segregation and Beyond - Lessons for Studying Structural Racism and Health</a> </p>
<p>As a Predoctoral Trainee at the <a href="http://coa.norc.org//#People/Training/PredocTrainees">Center on Demography and Economics of Aging</a>, and in collaboration with Louise Hawkley and Kathleen Cagney, I used data from the <a href="http://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-project.aspx">National Social Life Health and Aging Project</a> to measure the impact of living in a disadvantaged neighborhood on residential relocation in later life and how this varies by race.
Here is a <a href="http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/6/1131">link to our paper.</a> </p>

<p>In collaboration with Forrest Stuart, Grant Buhr and partners at the YMCA <a href="http://www.ymcachicago.org/programs/youth-safety-and-violence-prevention">Youth Safety and Violence Prevention Program</a>, I studied how adolescents navigate neighborhood violence in the digital age and if/how activity on social media turns into real-life violence. This project was made possible through funding from the University of Chicago <a href="http://uhi.uchospitals.edu/">Urban Health Initiative</a>.</p>

<a id="broader-interests" class="anchor" href="#broader-interests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Broader Interests</h3>

<p>I have a background in social epidemiology and community health, and much of my <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/admissions/scholarships/institutional-scholarships/sommer-scholars/scholars/?scholar=299">past work</a> focused on health issues facing Latino communities in the U.S. and Mexico.</p>
<p>Growing up in a community along the U.S. Mexico border- a region marked by stark inequality and contradiction - alerted me to the ways that health can make visible the social divisions and inequities most deeply naturalized in our society. This view of population health research as a tool in the struggle for equity and inclusion continues to motivate my work. I have been helping to launch the new Border Health Humanitarian Initiative <a href="https://www.borderhumanitarianhealth.org/"</a>, a multi-sectoral, multi-national coalition to convened to address the humanitarian health needs of migrants in transit and residing in the border regions from Central America to the U.S. Learn more: <a href: "https://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/news/top-academics-join-forces-tackle-health-and-humanitarian-crisis-border"</a>.</p> 

<p>I am also interested in computational methods for analysis of new data sources, as well as the ethical considerations of novel computational approaches to social science.
